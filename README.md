# Clima Project

![Finished Project](https://github.com/Tony-Kim09/Flutter-Projects/blob/master/Clima-Project/images/FinishedClima.PNG)

## What I Created

This is a simple weather app that tells you the weather at your current location through the use of openweathermap API.</br>
This app was created through the guidance of londonappbrewery bootcamp course. 

## What I Learned

- Using Dart to perform Asynchronous Tasks
- Understanding the use of Futures, async, and await
- Networking with Dart using http package
- Obtaining data using external APIs
- Parsing JSON data to readable format and displayed in user-friendly format
- Used Geolocator to obtain live locational data from android and iOS

## How to test the app yourself

If you would like to try the app yourself, make sure you create an account for openweathermap and obtain an API key.
After, in the services folder under weather.dart file, replace the apiKey variable with your API key and simply run the app.
